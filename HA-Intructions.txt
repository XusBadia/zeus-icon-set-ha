To add these icons to your Home Assistant, you just need to follow these simple steps:

1) Copy the www folder inside your Home Assistant.

2) Add this code to your configuration.yaml file:

frontend:
  extra_html_url:
    - /local/hass-zha-icons.html


That's it! To use the icons, just write 'zeus:icon_name'. (the 'icon_name' is the same as the SVG files inside the SVG folder).
